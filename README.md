ðŸ“Œ Project: AI Doctor Chatbot
ðŸ”¹ Project Description

The AI Doctor Chatbot is designed to interact with patients and provide basic medical advice based on their symptoms.

It simulates a virtual healthcare assistant that can suggest possible causes and treatments for common health issues.

The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning models to understand user input and generate appropriate responses.

The project aims to provide preliminary health guidance but is not a replacement for professional medical consultation.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Conversational chatbot for health-related queries.

Symptom-based prediction and advice.

Text preprocessing for better NLP understanding.

Machine learning integration for response generation.

Simple and user-friendly interaction.

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used

Python â€“ Core programming language.

NLTK â€“ For natural language processing and text preprocessing.

Machine Learning (ML) Models â€“ For intent classification and response prediction.

Google Colab- For model development and implementation

ðŸ”¹ Observations & Conclusion

The chatbot was able to accurately predict health-related responses for common symptoms.

It demonstrates how AI can assist in the medical domain by providing preliminary advice.

However, the system is not 100% accurate and should be considered only as a support tool.

Final observation: AI chatbots can reduce the initial workload of healthcare professionals and help patients with quick basic guidance, but real doctors are essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
